Fun with structures
===================

Go library for providing a key management service. This is a work in progress.

You'll need Go 1.7 or higher, since this code needs `C.CBytes()` for connection
to the C code.

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install golang-go
```

 * Pretty much everything.
